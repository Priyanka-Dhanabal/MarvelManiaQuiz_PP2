## UX

### Overview

MarvelMania is a Marvel Studio-themed quiz website I decided to comeup with as I love watching Marvel movies with my family and friends.

### Site Goal
  
The goal of the site is to provide users with bunch of questions and users will be able to view the score at the end of the quiz. The User will be able to provide a feedback and a star review at the end as well.

The user will be provided with a question along with four options, among which one option will be the correct answer. When a user chooses the correct answer they can move on to the next question but if they choose a wrong answer, it will be highlighted with the red and the correct answer will be shown.
