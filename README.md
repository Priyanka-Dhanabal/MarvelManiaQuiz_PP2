## UX

### Overview

MarvelMania is a Marvel Studio-themed quiz website I decided to comeup with as I love watching Marvel movies with my family and friends.

### Site Goal
  
The goal of the site is to provide users with bunch of questions and users will be able to view the score at the end of the quiz. The User will be able to provide a feedback and a star review at the end as well.

The user will be provided with a question along with four options, among which one option will be the correct answer. When a user chooses the correct answer they can move on to the next question but if they choose a wrong answer, it will be highlighted with the red and the correct answer will be shown.

## Testing

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
- Initially, I developed a code where the new question's answer buttons would get appended and removed when a user moves to the next question.
- When the game is finished and the user comes back to the Home page, where the start button is displayed. If the user wanted to play again by clicking the start button, the score was displayed not the questions with options.

- I was advised by my mentor that the code works but it is not feasible, so I had to change my code in such a way that, there are no new buttons created but update the innerText value in the existing button.
- This resolved the Bug. Now the user can play continuously.
